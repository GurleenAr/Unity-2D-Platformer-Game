Game

My game Little Adventures was created using Unity and C#. 
Within the game the player must reach the checkpoint at the end of each level to progress   through the game. Running into a trap or enemy will decrease player health and respawn player back to beginning of the level.

The game currently includes the following:
- 2 levels
- Moving platforms, and traps
- Moving Enemy which follows player within a certain range
- Checkpoint at the end of each level
- Collectable items on each levels
- Background music and sound effects
- Lighting
